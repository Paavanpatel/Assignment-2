sentiment Analysis on rotten tomato's movie review dataset
Today in the world racing towards the artificial
intelligence and deep networks it is necessary to progress in the field of language processing also. Language helps humans communicate with each other. In the same way we need to find
a more efficient way to make machine learn our language so that we can order the machine to do the task verbally. Since it is a long way to go here i have proposed a Tf-idf vectorizer
based CNN model to classify the reviews of multi class movie review dataset. Sentiments are important part of feedback and review survey.To know the real feeling behind the text a sentiment
analyser is the one we need to create. The proposed model gave better performance on the tri-gram model compared to bi-gram model. The accuracy of the models in each experiments was
around 60-61 percent.
